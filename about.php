      <h4> Hi, I'm Mena Wang</h4>
      <hr>
      <p> I'm a student at Cornell University, currently studying Computer Science in the
        College of Arts and Sciences. One of my favorite things to do is document my travels
      through photography.</p>

      <h4>About This Site</h4>
      <hr>
      <p>This site features a collection of my favorite scenic photos taken over the years.
      I have a special love for water and skies; all the photos presented will follow the theme
    of blue! Hope you enjoy.</p>

      <h4>Photography Skills</h4>
      <hr>
      <p> Besides the photos of myself, all photos were taken and edited by me.</p>
      <p> Ever since I was a child, I've been taking pictures of my family during gatherings. When I finally
        received my first camera, I shifted more towards landscape and scenary because I could
        explore and take pictures myself. Later in high school, I was able to learn through a Media Arts
        class more principles of photography to expand on the knowledge I already have and different editing
        programs to edit my pictures</p>
      <p> Choice of equipment: Canon Rebel T2i, Samsung Galaxy S7</p>
      <p> Editing: Photoshop, VSCO, Lightroom </p>
